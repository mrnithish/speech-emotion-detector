# Emotion Detection with Voice Input

## Overview

This Python project performs emotion detection using voice input. It analyzes audio data to recognize emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, etc., based on voice characteristics.

## Features

- **Voice Emotion Detection**: The script processes voice input to detect emotions.
- **Real-Time Feedback**: Provides real-time emotion analysis and feedback.
- **Requirements File**: A `requirements.txt` file is included for easy library installation.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, make sure you have:

- Python 3.x installed
- The required libraries installed (see the `requirements.txt` file)
- A microphone for voice input

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mrnithish/speech-emotion-detector.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd emotion-detection-voice
```

3. Install the required libraries using `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Run the Python script:

```bash
python emotion detector.py
```

2. Speak into the microphone, and the script will analyze the input to detect the emotion.

3. The detected emotion can be displayed in real-time or saved to a file.

## Customization

You can customize the script to recognize additional emotions or improve the accuracy by modifying the emotion recognition logic in the `emotion detector.py` file.
